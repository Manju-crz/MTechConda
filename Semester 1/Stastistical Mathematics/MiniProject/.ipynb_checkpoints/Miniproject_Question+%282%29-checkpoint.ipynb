(2020). UCI Machine Learning Repository. . The data file is attached as csv file. The following are details being provided . The data contains details on actual productivty of a garment industry, the data has been recorded on a day to day basis from the year 2015 to almost year end of 2015. Each quarter represents one week in a month. The days beyond 28 days are considered as quarter 5 which can be ignored. The data set at first needs to be examined and the structure of the data set needs to be understood. The data has been recorded in terms of the following details\n",
